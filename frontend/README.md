# MyDocket - Frontend

### Setup

A skeleton React/Webpack setup with hot-reloading. Feel free to switch modules as you need for styling, or swap in Vue if you prefer.

1. `nvm install 10.14.0 && nvm use 10.14.0`
2. `npm install`
3. `npm start`

### Styles

To simplify CSS setup and usage for this exercise, we included the StyledComponents lib which lets you essentially write CSS in your JS files. If you prefer a traditional CSS writing experience, you can write your CSS to the `GlobalStyle.js` file or create styled components as needed.
